This is game like 2048, but you have more choice to play it. For example, you can set the length of table more than 4 or less than it. You can even play it random by turn on the "auto_mode". If you wanna develop it, you can also use "test_mode".

I think the code which I write is beautiful enough that you will read it confortablely, but it just "I think...". I didn't make any comment in my code, because of the fluence to my writing. So if you want add some comment to it, I have no objection.

Why the game's name called "mergame" is because I have trouble in "merge" when I writing code. But merging is the major content, so I spend lots of time on revising. At last I change the name of game in memory of my hard work.
